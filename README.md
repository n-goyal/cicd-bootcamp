Ansible playbook contains steps to configure a tomcat service on a ubuntu desktop. tomcat.service file is used to enable tomcat as a service on ubuntu machine. this ansible playbook with a few modificaitons can be used on a cloud server or in a local system to configure tomcat. I used this to configure tomcat on my ubuntu machine by running the following command.
